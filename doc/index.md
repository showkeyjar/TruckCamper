### Preface

In primitive society,we live for food.

In slave society,we live for land.

In feudal society,we live for freedom.

In capitalist society,we live for fortune.

But today,we just live for house.

It's big funny.that's not I want.

I think the future,we must live for attraction!

we have so many greate advantage for free our body.
but we still have little advantage for free our mind.

we build super cities,but city slave us.

we build super machines,but machine slave us.

we build super AI...

why can't we stop do those slave things!

Just to do something that can free our body,free our mind?

Life should be beautifull and interesting!

we must work for food,work for dress,work for travel,work for live...

ok!enough!forget those works!

Everything that slave us must be automated!

In this project,I just wish everyone can be free.Everyone can become the master of his life.

If you like this project,please join with me,and star it!thanks!
